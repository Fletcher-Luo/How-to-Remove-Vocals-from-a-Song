# How-to-Remove-Vocals-from-a-Song
This file is concerned about the experience how I removed vocals from a song by spleeter.

I just don't want to forget the process.

This is a memorandum for myself, which might help others.

## Install Python
First, you need to install Python. The latest version may not be compatible with spleeter up to now(2022.3.24). I used Python 3.8.0 and it worked.

## Install spleeter
Run Windows PowerShell.

Use `pip install spleeter` to install spleeter.

## Install FFmpeg
Install FFmpeg from **ffmpeg.org**.
